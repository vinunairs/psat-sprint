  const BANK = [
    { q: "Where in a eukaryotic cell does glycolysis take place?", o: ["Cytosol", "Mitochondrial matrix", "Inner mitochondrial membrane", "Intermembrane space"], e: "Glycolysis happens in the cytosol, outside the mitochondria. That's why it works in every cell, including bacteria and red blood cells (which have no mitochondria)." },
    { q: "Where does the citric acid (Krebs) cycle take place in a eukaryotic cell?", o: ["Mitochondrial matrix", "Cytosol", "Inner mitochondrial membrane", "Outer mitochondrial membrane"], e: "The cycle's enzymes are in the matrix. The membrane is home to the electron transport chain and ATP synthase." },
    { q: "What is the final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration?", o: ["O₂", "NAD⁺", "Pyruvate", "CO₂"], e: "Complex IV hands electrons to O₂, which picks up H⁺ to form water. NAD⁺ is an electron carrier earlier in the pathway, not the final acceptor." },
    { q: "In which stages is CO₂ released?", o: ["Pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle", "Glycolysis only", "The electron transport chain", "Glycolysis and the electron transport chain"], e: "2 CO₂ leave in pyruvate oxidation and 4 in the citric acid cycle, per glucose. Glycolysis splits glucose without releasing any carbon." },
    { q: "What is the net ATP yield of glycolysis per glucose?", o: ["2 ATP", "4 ATP", "0 ATP", "About 30 ATP"], e: "Glycolysis invests 2 ATP and makes 4, for a net gain of 2. \"4 ATP\" is the gross number, a common trap." },
    { q: "What is the main purpose of fermentation?", o: ["To regenerate NAD⁺ so glycolysis can keep running", "To make extra ATP from pyruvate", "To produce oxygen for the electron transport chain", "To feed acetyl-CoA into the citric acid cycle"], e: "Without O₂, NADH can't unload at the electron transport chain. Fermentation passes NADH's electrons to pyruvate (or acetaldehyde), regenerating NAD⁺. It makes no extra ATP; the cell lives on glycolysis's net 2." },
    { q: "During electron transport, protons are pumped:", o: ["From the matrix into the intermembrane space", "From the intermembrane space into the matrix", "From the cytosol into the matrix", "From the matrix into the cytosol"], e: "Complexes I, III and IV pump H⁺ out of the matrix into the intermembrane space. H⁺ then flows back into the matrix through ATP synthase, driving ATP synthesis." },
    { q: "Oligomycin blocks ATP synthase. What happens in the mitochondria right after it is added?", o: ["The proton gradient stays high and ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation stops", "The proton gradient collapses and energy is released as heat", "Glycolysis stops immediately", "Oxygen consumption increases sharply"], e: "With ATP synthase blocked, H⁺ can't flow back, so the gradient builds and ATP synthesis stops. A steep gradient then slows the chain, so O₂ use falls. Collapsing the gradient as heat is what an uncoupler does." },
    { q: "An uncoupler such as DNP makes the inner mitochondrial membrane leaky to protons. What happens?", o: ["O₂ consumption rises while ATP synthesis falls", "O₂ consumption and ATP synthesis both rise", "O₂ consumption and ATP synthesis both fall", "O₂ consumption stops completely"], e: "Protons leak back without passing through ATP synthase, so ATP output falls. The chain runs faster to try to rebuild the gradient, burning more O₂, and the energy is lost as heat." },
    { q: "Why does each FADH₂ yield less ATP than each NADH?", o: ["Its electrons enter at complex II, skipping the protons pumped at complex I", "FADH₂ carries fewer electrons than NADH", "FADH₂ is made in the cytosol and must be transported in", "FADH₂ gives its electrons straight to O₂"], e: "Both carry two electrons. FADH₂ hands them to complex II, which pumps no protons, so fewer H⁺ are pumped per FADH₂ (about 1.5 ATP vs. about 2.5 for NADH)." },
    { q: "About how many ATP does aerobic respiration yield per glucose, using current textbook estimates?", o: ["About 30–32", "About 2", "About 12", "About 60"], e: "Current estimates are about 30–32 ATP per glucose. Older books say 36–38; the DAT usually asks in ways where either fits, like \"far more than glycolysis alone.\"" },
    { q: "Which products are made by fermentation in yeast?", o: ["Ethanol and CO₂", "Lactate only", "Acetyl-CoA and NADH", "O₂ and glucose"], e: "Yeast (alcoholic) fermentation turns pyruvate into ethanol and CO₂. Lactic acid fermentation, in muscle cells and some bacteria, makes lactate and no CO₂." },
    { q: "In a prokaryote, where is the electron transport chain located?", o: ["Plasma membrane", "Inner mitochondrial membrane", "Cytosol", "Nucleoid"], e: "Prokaryotes have no mitochondria. Their electron transport chain sits in the plasma membrane, and protons are pumped out of the cell." },
    { q: "Which molecule enters the citric acid cycle by combining with oxaloacetate?", o: ["Acetyl-CoA", "Pyruvate", "Glucose", "Lactate"], e: "Acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) joins oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to form citrate (6 carbons), the first step of each turn." },
    { q: "Substrate-level phosphorylation makes ATP during:", o: ["Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle", "The electron transport chain only", "Pyruvate oxidation only", "ATP synthase activity"], e: "An enzyme moves a phosphate directly onto ADP in glycolysis and in one step of the citric acid cycle. ATP synthase makes ATP by oxidative phosphorylation instead." },
    { q: "Cyanide blocks complex IV. Which effect is expected in a cell?", o: ["NADH builds up and the citric acid cycle slows", "NAD⁺ builds up and glycolysis speeds up only in mitochondria", "The proton gradient becomes steeper", "O₂ consumption increases"], e: "Electrons can't reach O₂, so the chain backs up: NADH can't be oxidized, NAD⁺ runs short, and the NAD⁺-dependent citric acid cycle slows. The gradient fades and O₂ use drops." }
